# Declarative Cluster Management

## Overview

A tool that enables programmers to specify cluster management policies in a
high-level declarative language, and compute policy-compliant configurations
automatically and efficiently. Weave allows constraints and policies, the
essence of a cluster manager, to be easily added, removed and modified
over time, using a language familiar to developers (SQL).
